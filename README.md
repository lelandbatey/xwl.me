# Xwl.me

This is a public repo for the code behind http://xwl.me, a live markup language parsing service.

## Features:

Xwl.me can be used to parse both Markdown and ReStructuredText documents. Both are parsed using the reference implemenations of their respective language parsers.

## Tech Used:

 - Flask
 - Markdown (python parsing service)
 - SQLAlchemy (SQL ORM for Python)

### Notes:

Xwl.me was created originally to (1) scratch an itch, and (2) learn a bit about using databases.
